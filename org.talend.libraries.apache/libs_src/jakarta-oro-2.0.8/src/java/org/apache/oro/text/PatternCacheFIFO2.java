/**
 * This class is a GenericPatternCache subclass implementing a second
 * chance FIFO (First In First Out) cache replacement policy.  In other
 * words, patterns are added to the cache until the cache becomes full.
 * Once the cache is full, when a new pattern is added to the cache, it 
 * replaces the first of the current patterns in the cache to have been
 * added, unless that pattern has been used recently (generally
 * between the last cache replacement and now).
 * If the pattern to be replaced has been used, it is given
 * a second chance, and the next pattern in the cache is tested for
 * replacement in the same manner.  If all the patterns are given a
 * second chance, then the original pattern selected for replacement is
 * replaced.
